## Description

This project involved creating a trivia game in which the player guessed questions relating to NBA history under a timed setting and getting a final score.

- The motivation for creating this project was developing vanilla JavaScript skills in order to be able to add significant interactivity to a static HTML page.
- I built this project in order to continue developing JavaScript skills. Creating an HTML page and designing it with CSS is one matter, but adding the ability for the user to interact is an entirely different matter. This project required several different levels of interactivity, including cycling through buttons and questions, recording a score, altering a running timer, and saving a score to local storage within the browser.
- This is a useful project in that it creates a page that a user can play a game with. This lends itself to numerous possibilities across the web, including interactive games, recording user choices as variables, and storing said variables so that if the user returns they are building off of what they recorded previously.
- This project was immensely frustrating for me, and likely the most difficult thing I have ever been asked to do academically. The greatest challenge was creating event listeners that properly cycled through a question index upon click so that the user could proceed through the trivia game. I also learned a lot about how to affect different live elements on a page, such as a score and timer. Furthermore, this was an introduction to local storage, which enables a browser to store values within it's cache and so that it can remember those values for a returning user.

## Installation

- There is no specialized installation required to use this webpage. All functionality is built into the page itself through JavaScript, which changes the displayed HTML elements. The user can play the trivia game without downloading any applications or extensions.

## Credits

- I could not have completed this project without the help and encouragement my professor Joe Ruefess, TA's, W3Schools, MDM, and my tutor Jacob Carver.

## Usage

-Using this website is straightforward. Once the page loads, the user clicks the "Check Ball!" button, and the timer and first question of the quiz appears. The user may click on the next or previous question buttons in order to cycle through questions, and their answers will be recorded. An incorrect answer will subtract 5 seconds from the timer. Upon completion of the quiz, the user will receive their score.
